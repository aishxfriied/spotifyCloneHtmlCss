# Spotify Clone — HTML / CSS Version

## Project Overview  
This is a front‑end clone of the Spotify interface, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and minimal JavaScript (with Java integration planned).  
It demonstrates my ability to replicate a modern music‑app UI using core web technologies.  
The project is structured to be clean, responsive and easily extendible.

## Features  
- Sidebar navigation (Home, Search, Library)  
- Main content area showing playlists/albums/songs  
- Responsive layout (desktop and mobile)  
- Custom styling to mimic Spotify’s dark theme and accent colour  
- Simple file/folder structure:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `script.js` (for basic interaction)
  - `Images/` folder for album art, icons, etc.
  - (Future) `java/` folder for Java‑based logic

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid)  
- JavaScript (for basic UI interaction)  
- (Future) Java – to demonstrate backend or logic capabilities  
No frameworks — built from scratch to show proficiency in vanilla web tech.
